This is the repo for the Stanford Alpaca project, which aims to build and share an instruction-following LLaMA model. The repo contains:
- A [**web demo**](https://crfm.stanford.edu/alpaca/) to interact with our Alpaca model
- The [52K data](#data-release) used for fine-tuning the model
- The code for [generating the data](#data-generation-process)

## Overview

The current Alpaca model is fine-tuned from a 7B LLaMA model [1] on 52K instruction-following data generated by the techniques in the Self-Instruct [2] paper, with some modifications that we discuss in the next section.
In a preliminary human evaluation, we found that the Alpaca 7B model behaves similarly to the `text-davinci-003` model on the Self-Instruct instruction-following evaluation suite [2].

Alpaca is still under development, and there are many limitations that have to be addressed.
Importantly, we have not yet fine-tuned the Alpaca model to be safe and harmless.
We thus encourage users to be cautious when interacting with Alpaca, and to report any concerning behavior to help improve the safety and ethical considerations of the model.

Our initial release contains the data generation procedure, dataset, and training recipe. We intend to release the model weights if we are given permission to do so by the creators of LLaMA. For now, we have chosen to host a live demo to help readers better understand the capabilities and limits of Alpaca, as well as a way to help us better evaluate Alpaca's performance on a broader audience.

**Please read our release [blog post](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) for more details about the model, our discussion of the potential harm and limitations of Alpaca models, and our thought process for releasing a reproducible model.**

## Data Release
[`alpaca_data.json`](./alpaca_data.json) contains 52K instruction-following data we used for fine-tuning the Alpaca model.
This JSON file is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains the following fields:
- `instruction`: `str`, describes the task the model should perform. Each of the 52K instructions is unique.
- `input`: `str`, optional context or input for the task. For example, when the instruction is "Summarize the following article", the input is the article. Around 40% of the examples have an input.
- `output`: `str`, the answer to the instruction as generated by `text-davinci-003`.

We used the following prompts for fine-tuning the Alpaca model:
- for examples with a non-empty input field:
 ```
 Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
 
 ### Instruction:
 {instruction}
 
 ### Input:
 {input}
 
 ### Response:
 ```
- for examples with an empty input field:
 ```
 Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
 
 ### Instruction:
 {instruction}
 
 ### Response:
 ```
 
 During inference (eg for the web demo), we use the user instruction with an empty input field (second option).

## Data Generation Process

<details>
<summary> <strong> Running the code </strong> </summary>

1. Set environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key.
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python -m generate_instruction generate_instruction_following_data` to generate the data.

</details>

We built on the data generation pipeline from [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct) and made the following modifications:
- We used `text-davinci-003` to generate the instruction data instead of `davinci`.
- We wrote a new prompt (`prompt.txt`) that explicitly gave the requirement of instruction generation to `text-davinci-003`. Note: there is a slight error in the prompt we used, and future users should incorporate the edit in https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/pull/24
- We adopted much more aggressive batch decoding, i.e., generating 20 instructions at once, which significantly reduced the cost of data generation.
- We simplified the data generation pipeline by discarding the difference between classification and non-classification instructions.
- We only generated a single instance for each instruction, instead of 2 to 3 instances as in [1].

This produced an instruction-following dataset with 52K examples obtained at a much lower cost (less than $500). 
In a preliminary study, we also find our 52K generated data to be much more diverse than the data released by [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/blob/main/data/seed_tasks.jsonl).
We plot the below figure (in the style of Figure 2 in the [self-instruct paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560) to demonstrate the diversity of our data.
The inner circle of the plot represents the root verb of the instructions, and the outer circle represents the direct objects.

## Fine-tuning
We fine-tune our models using standard Hugging Face training code with the following hyperparameters:

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Batch size     | 128   |
| Learning rate  | 2e-5  |
| Epochs         | 3     |
| Max length     | 512   |
 | Weight decay   | 0     |

Given Hugging Face hasn't officially supported the LLaMA models, we fine-tuned LLaMA with Hugging Face's transformers library by installing it from a particular fork (i.e. this [PR](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/21955) to be merged).
The hash of the specific commit we installed was `68d640f7c368bcaaaecfc678f11908ebbd3d6176`.

To reproduce our fine-tuning runs for LLaMA, first install the requirements 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, install the particular libraries. 

# ChatLLaMA with Stanford Alpaca on NVIDIA A100 

## Install Cog and Dependencies 
'''
$ curl -o /usr/local/bin/cog -L \ https://github.com/replicate/cog/releases/latest/download/cog_`uname -s`_`uname -m` 

$ chmod +x /home/snit.san/bin/cog 
'''

To solve error "keyError:llama" 
'''
$ pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers 

$ conda install sentencepiece -c huggingface 
'''

## Step 1: Clone the Alpaca repository 

Log into your GPU instance via SSH. Clone the repository by running: 

''' 

$ git clone https://github.com/replicate/cog_stanford_alpaca 
$ cd cog_stanford_alpaca 

''' 
## Step 2: Convert the LLaMA weights 

The LLaMA weights are currently only available for research use. To apply for access, fill out this Meta Research form. 

Put your downloaded weights in a folder called unconverted-weights. The folder hierarchy should look something like this: 

unconverted-weights 
''' 

|── 7B 
│      ├── checklist.chk 
│      ├── consolidated.00.pth 

│      └── params.json 
├── tokenizer.model 
└── tokenizer_checklist.chk 

''' 

Convert the weights from a PyTorch checkpoint to a transformers-compatible format using this command: 

''' 

$ cog run python -m transformers.models.llama.convert_llama_weights_to_hf \ 
--input_dir unconverted-weights \ 
--model_size 7B \ 
--output_dir weights 

''' 

You final directory structure should look like this: 

''' 

Weights 

 
├── llama-7b 

└── tokenizermdki 

''' 

## Step 3: Train the model 

''' 

"ValueError: Tokenizer class LLaMATokenizer does not exist " 

''' 

 

This is arising, because the tokenizer in the config on the hub points to LLaMATokenizer. However, the tokenizer in the library is LlamaTokenizer. 

 

https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/22222 

''' 

"Could not find the transformer layer class to wrap in the model 

" 

''' 

Try changing fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap to LlamaDecoderLayer 

 

https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/issues/58 

 

Kick off the training:    Three Nodes, 8*3 = 24 GPUs 

https://lambdalabs.com/blog/multi-node-pytorch-distributed-training-guide 

 

Training on 40GB GPUs A100:- 

"torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 44.00 MiB (GPU 6; 39.59 GiB total capacity; 37.09 GiB already allocated; 30.19 MiB free; 37.68 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch) If reserved memory is >> allocated memory try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation." 

 

NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs are not enough resources to "train model'.

## ChatLLaMA inference test: 

''' 

$  cog predict -i prompt="tell me something about รามาเกรียน " 

''' 

''' 

[ 

  "Ramakien is a Thai version of the Hindu epic, Ramayana. It is the national epic of Thailand and is based on the life of the god Rama and his struggle against the evil demon Ravana. The epic is told through a series of paintings and is part of the Buddhist faith in Thailand." 

] 

''' 


About 39 minutes for  training, "609/609 [38:53<00:00,  3.83s/it]" 



Note the given training script is meant to be simple and easy to use, and is not particularly optimized.
To run on more gpus, you may prefer to turn down `gradient_accumulation_steps` to keep a global batch size of 128. Global batch size has not been tested for optimality.
